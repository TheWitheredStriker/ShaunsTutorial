/// @description A GML script with variables. It executes when our guy is created.

// Variables declared without var are instance variables. They can be accessed everywhere.
// Variables declared with var are local variables. 
// They use less memory and can't be used outside of the script or scope it was declared in.
// It's a best practice to use var unless you really need to create global variables.
